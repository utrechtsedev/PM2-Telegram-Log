A light Node.js Library that resolves Telegram usernames and/or ids to a complete User or/and Chat JSON object(s)

> Powered by [PWRTelegram API](http://pwrtelegram.xyz/)

## Background

The official Telegram API **does not** allow bots to resolve usernames/ids out of the box. One is forced to create his/her own database so as to resolve usernames. Resolving of usernames is particularly useful in that a bot is able to get a user/chat id of a person or groub it hasn't even seen! Unlike before where a bot is only able to see a person if it has ever recieved his/her message whether in private or in a group.

## Useful Scenarios

- Group administration bots
- In a bot which has lost its database, but users had previously started the bot
- General resolving to get user details e.g [UResolverBot](https://telegram.me/UResolverBot)
- And much more!


## Install

```bash
$ npm install tg-resolve --save
```

## Usage

```js
const tgresolve = require("tg-resolve");

// using the 'bare' function
tgresolve(token, "@kamikazechaser", function(error, result) {
    // ... handle error ...
    console.log(result.id);
});

// you can create a client (referred to as 'resolver')
// that you can repeatedly use
const resolver = new tgresolver.Tgresolve(token);

// using the 'resolver'
resolver.tgresolve("@kamikazechaser", function(error, result) {
    // ... handle error ...
    console.log(result.id);
});
```

- As of v1.2.0, you will need your own bot token!
- As of v1.3.0, you can pass in your own pwrtg url!
