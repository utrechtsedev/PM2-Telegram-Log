**PM2-Telegram-Log**

Log your errors correctly and get notified every hour in case something breaks. Great for new software you need to roll out without having days to spare for testing (Testing in productionðŸ¤­).

**How to start**

Just download or clone the repo, edit .env file and fill in your Telegram bot token and chat id. Then you can directly run it by ``pm2 start log.js`` or ``node log.js``.

Good luck!
